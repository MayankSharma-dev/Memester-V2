- **Network Bound Resource**: To manage network requests and local caching efficiently.
- **Coroutines and Flow**: To handle asynchronous tasks with minimal boilerplate code.

## Architecture

This app follows modern architectural practices, including:

- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: To separate concerns and keep the UI logic clean and maintainable.
- **Repository Pattern**: To abstract data sources and provide a clean interface to the ViewModel.
- **Use of Kotlin Flows**: For asynchronous programming and reactive UI updates.
- **Hilt for Dependency Injection**: To manage dependencies efficiently and keep the code decoupled.
